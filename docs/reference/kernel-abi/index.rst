Kernel ABI
##########

The SLASH kernel module (``slash.ko``) exposes AMD Alveo V80 FPGA cards to userspace through a set
of character devices. It drives two PCI physical functions per card and registers three categories
of device nodes: a per-card control device for BAR enumeration and MMIO access, a per-card QDMA
device for DMA queue management, and a single global hotplug device for PCIe lifecycle operations.

This reference specifies the ioctl ABI for all three device categories. It begins with data
conventions that apply uniformly across all devices, followed by a per-device chapter containing a
usage guide and a formal reference for each ioctl operation. Every ioctl entry follows the same
structure: a top-level description, the C interface definition, the ioctl direction, preconditions
on inputs, postconditions on outputs, and return values.

The module uses the Linux ``miscdevice`` framework to create the following device files, which
allocates dynamic minor numbers under major 10. Userspace discovers device nodes by path, not by
major/minor number.

``/dev/slash_ctl<N>`` / ``/sys/class/misc/slash_ctl_<BDF>/device``
    Provides BAR enumeration, MMIO access, and PCI device identity. Associated with PF2 (device ID
    ``10EE:50B6``). Examples: ``/dev/slash_ctl0``, ``/dev/slash_ctl1``,
    ``/sys/class/misc/slash_ctl_0000:61:00.2/device``.

``/dev/slash_qdma_ctl<N>`` / ``/sys/class/misc/slash_qdma_ctl_<BDF>/device``
    Manages DMA queue pairs for bulk data movement between host and card memory, as well as
    reconfiguration. Associated with PF1 (device ID ``10EE:50B5``). Examples: ``/dev/slash_qdma_ctl0``,
    ``/dev/slash_qdma_ctl1``, ``/sys/class/misc/slash_qdma_ctl_0000:61:00.0/device``.

``/dev/slash_hotplug``
    A single global instance created at module load. Provides privileged control over the PCIe
    lifecycle of SLASH cards (remove, rescan, secondary bus reset).

The kernel module creates one ``slash_ctl`` and ``slash_qdma_ctl`` file for each card during discovery,
which persist across reconfiguration, but will be removed and readded during a remove+rescan cycle.
The mapping of one file path to a physical card is therefore not guaranteed across remove+rescan cycles
and userspace should always verify the BDF identity of the accessed card. Also, suffixes for one card are
not guaranteed to be identical for ``/dev/slash_ctl<N>`` and ``/dev/slash_qdma_ctl<N>``. For example, 
the device files ``/dev/slash_ctl0`` and ``/dev/slash_qdma_ctl1`` may reference the same physical card.

The files in the ``/sys/class/misc/`` directory are symlinks to the respective files in ``/dev``,
and the placeholder ``<BDF>`` equates to the full, function-level BDF identifier of the physical
function. For example, the physical function 2 of board ``0000:61:00`` may be available as
``/sys/class/misc/slash_ctl_0000:61:00.2``.

Data Conventions
================

ABI Versioning
--------------

Every ioctl argument struct carries a leading ``__u32 size`` field. Callers must set
``size = sizeof(struct ...)`` before issuing the ioctl. The kernel reads ``size`` first, then
copies ``min(user_size, kernel_size)`` bytes in. Fields the kernel knows about but the caller's
older struct does not include are zero-filled. The response is written back for
``min(user_size, kernel_size)`` bytes; if ``user_size > kernel_size``, the kernel zero-fills the
extra tail via ``clear_user()``. This allows the driver and library to evolve independently.

Error Handling
--------------

All ioctls return ``0`` on success or a negative errno on failure, except for some ioctls that use
the return value as a file descriptor (described below). The standard errno values are documented
under each ioctl. Unknown ioctl command numbers return ``-ENOTTY``.

Concurrency Model
=================

The intent is that all ioctls and ``read()``/``write()`` calls in this ABI are safe to invoke
concurrently from multiple threads or processes, on the same fd or on different fds. Concurrent
calls must never corrupt kernel state, and the kernel is expected to serialize internally where
necessary.

.. note::

   The current kernel driver is not exhaustively tested for concurrent access and bugs in this
   area may exist. Treat the safety property as an intent rather than a verified guarantee.

Conceptually, a queue pair is a sequential resource: the hardware processes one ``read()`` or
``write()`` on a given qpair at a time. The kernel serializes concurrent I/O on the same qpair,
so issuing ``read()``/``write()`` from multiple threads, or via multiple ``QPAIR_GET_FD`` fds for
the same qpair, is safe but offers no throughput benefit over a single-threaded caller. For
parallel I/O, allocate multiple qpairs via ``QPAIR_ADD`` and distribute transfers across them.

Hotplug ioctls from multiple processes serialize on ``pci_lock_rescan_remove()``.
``TOGGLE_SBR`` drops this lock before calling ``pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset()`` to avoid
deadlock with the PCI slot lock.

Card information and BARs: ``/dev/slash_ctl<N>``
================================================

The control device provides two services. First, BAR enumeration and access: callers query which
of the card's PCIe BARs are present and usable, then obtain a dma-buf fd for each BAR they wish to
memory-map for direct MMIO register access. Second, device identity: callers read the card's PCI
BDF string and vendor/device IDs to correlate the control device with a physical board and with the
matching QDMA control device.

- **Device file name:** ``/dev/slash_ctl<N>`` (e.g. ``/dev/slash_ctl0``)
- **Sysfs name:** ``slash_ctl_<PCI-BDF>`` (e.g., ``/sys/class/misc/slash_ctl_slash_ctl_0000:61:00.2``)
- **Associated PCI function:** PF2, device ID ``10EE:50B6``
- **Permissions:** ``0600`` (owner read/write)
- **Creation:** one per card, created when PF2 is probed during module load or PCI rescan
- **File operations:** ``ioctl`` only — no ``open`` hook, no ``read``, ``write``, or ``mmap``
  on this fd itself. MMIO access is through a dma-buf fd returned by an ioctl.

Usage
-----

Querying Device Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before accessing BARs, callers typically identify the card and enumerate its available BARs using
``SLASH_CTLDEV_IOCTL_GET_DEVICE_INFO`` and ``SLASH_CTLDEV_IOCTL_GET_BAR_INFO``. The device info
ioctl returns the BDF string and PCI IDs, which correlate this control device with the matching
QDMA device at the same BDF (function 1). The BAR info ioctl reports per-BAR metadata: whether
the BAR is present and usable for MMIO, its physical address, and its size.

.. code-block:: c

    /* Query PCI identity */
    struct slash_ioctl_device_info dev_info = { .size = sizeof(dev_info) };
    ioctl(ctl_fd, SLASH_CTLDEV_IOCTL_GET_DEVICE_INFO, &dev_info);
    /* dev_info.bdf → e.g. "0000:61:00.2" */
    /* dev_info.vendor_id == 0x10EE, dev_info.device_id == 0x50B6 */

    /* Enumerate all six BARs */
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        struct slash_ioctl_bar_info bar_info = {
            .size       = sizeof(bar_info),
            .bar_number = i,
        };
        ioctl(ctl_fd, SLASH_CTLDEV_IOCTL_GET_BAR_INFO, &bar_info);
        if (bar_info.usable)
            printf("BAR%d: addr=0x%016llx length=0x%llx\n",
                   i, bar_info.start_address, bar_info.length);
    }

BAR Access and MMIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each PCIe BAR is accessed through a dma-buf fd obtained from ``SLASH_CTLDEV_IOCTL_GET_BAR_FD``.
The fd is mapped with ``mmap()`` to obtain a pointer for direct MMIO register access. All reads
and writes through that pointer must be bracketed with ``DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC`` calls on the
dma-buf fd to ensure correct memory ordering.

.. code-block:: c

    #include <linux/dma-buf.h>

    /* Obtain a dma-buf fd for BAR 0 — return value is the fd, not 0 */
    struct slash_ioctl_bar_fd_request req = {
        .size       = sizeof(req),
        .bar_number = 0,
        .flags      = O_CLOEXEC,
    };
    int bar_fd = ioctl(ctl_fd, SLASH_CTLDEV_IOCTL_GET_BAR_FD, &req);
    /* req.length is now filled with the BAR size */

    void *mmio = mmap(NULL, req.length, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, bar_fd, 0);

    /* MMIO write: bracket with SYNC_WRITE */
    struct dma_buf_sync sync = { .flags = DMA_BUF_SYNC_START | DMA_BUF_SYNC_WRITE };
    ioctl(bar_fd, DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC, &sync);
    /* ... MMIO writes via mmio pointer ... */
    sync.flags = DMA_BUF_SYNC_END | DMA_BUF_SYNC_WRITE;
    ioctl(bar_fd, DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC, &sync);

    /* MMIO read: same pattern with SYNC_READ */
    sync.flags = DMA_BUF_SYNC_START | DMA_BUF_SYNC_READ;
    ioctl(bar_fd, DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC, &sync);
    /* ... MMIO reads via mmio pointer ... */
    sync.flags = DMA_BUF_SYNC_END | DMA_BUF_SYNC_READ;
    ioctl(bar_fd, DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC, &sync);

    /* Teardown */
    munmap(mmio, req.length);
    close(bar_fd);

BAR mapping is **not inherited across** ``fork()``. Each child process that needs MMIO access must
obtain its own dma-buf fd via ``GET_BAR_FD``.

After a device is removed from the PCI hierarchy, mapped BAR regions remain accessible in virtual
memory. However, all physical accesses will return ``0xFFFFFFFF`` (PCIe completion timeout) and
writes are silently discarded.

After a device is removed from the PCI hierarchy, mapped BAR regions remain accessible in virtual
memory but their behavior is undefined. Userspace should treat the mapping as invalid after removal..

IOCTL Reference
---------------

All control device ioctls use magic byte ``'v'`` (``0x76``) and sequence numbers ``0x30``–``0x32``.

``SLASH_CTLDEV_IOCTL_GET_BAR_INFO``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reads BAR metadata for a single BAR index, reporting whether the BAR is present and usable for
MMIO access along with its physical address and size.

**Interface:**

.. code-block:: c

    #define SLASH_CTLDEV_IOCTL_GET_BAR_INFO _IOWR('v', 0x30, struct slash_ioctl_bar_info)

    struct slash_ioctl_bar_info {
        __u32 size;           /* [in/out] ABI version: set to sizeof(struct) */
        __u8  bar_number;     /* [in]  BAR index to query: 0–5 */
        __u8  usable;         /* [out] Non-zero if BAR is present and is MMIO */
        __u8  in_use;         /* [out] Always 0 in current implementation */
        __u8  pad0;           /* padding */
        __u64 start_address;  /* [out] Physical/bus start address of the BAR */
        __u64 length;         /* [out] Size of the BAR in bytes */
    };

**Direction:** ``_IOWR`` — userspace writes ``bar_number`` (and ``size``); the kernel writes back
``usable``, ``in_use``, ``start_address``, and ``length``.

**Preconditions:**

- ``size`` must cover at least ``length``
- ``bar_number`` must be in ``[0, 5]``

**Postconditions:**

- ``usable`` = 1 if the BAR has a non-zero start address and is ``IORESOURCE_MEM`` (MMIO type)
- ``in_use`` = 0 (reserved for future use; never set in current implementation)
- ``start_address`` = physical bus address
- ``length`` = BAR size in bytes

**Return values:**

- ``0`` — success
- ``-EFAULT`` — bad userspace pointer in ``copy_from_user`` or ``copy_to_user``
- ``-EINVAL`` — ``size`` too small, or ``bar_number`` out of ``[0, 5]``

``SLASH_CTLDEV_IOCTL_GET_BAR_FD``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a new dma-buf file descriptor for the named BAR. The fd can be passed to ``mmap()`` to
obtain a pointer for direct MMIO access. The BAR size is reported back in ``length``. The fd is
returned as the ``ioctl()`` return value.

**Interface:**

.. code-block:: c

    #define SLASH_CTLDEV_IOCTL_GET_BAR_FD _IOWR('v', 0x31, struct slash_ioctl_bar_fd_request)

    struct slash_ioctl_bar_fd_request {
        __u32 size;        /* [in/out] ABI version */
        __u8  bar_number;  /* [in]  BAR index: 0–5 */
        __u8  pad0;        /* padding */
        __u16 pad1;        /* padding */
        __u32 flags;       /* [in]  fd flags: only O_CLOEXEC is honoured */
        __u64 length;      /* [out] Size of the BAR in bytes */
    };

**Direction:** ``_IOWR`` — userspace writes ``bar_number`` and ``flags``; the kernel writes back
``length`` and returns the new fd as the ``ioctl()`` return value (not as a struct field).

**Preconditions:**

- ``size`` must cover at least ``length``
- ``bar_number`` in ``[0, 5]``
- ``flags & ~O_CLOEXEC == 0`` (any other flag bits cause ``-EINVAL``)
- The specified BAR must be a usable MMIO BAR (must have an active dma-buf exporter)

**Postconditions:**

- The return value is a non-negative fd number on success.
- The fd refers to a dma-buf exporter for the named BAR and can be passed to ``mmap()``.
- ``length`` is filled with the BAR size; callers use this to size the ``mmap()`` call.

**Return values:**

- ``>= 0`` — file descriptor (success)
- ``-EFAULT`` — copy failure
- ``-EINVAL`` — ``size`` too small, ``bar_number`` out of range, or unsupported ``flags`` bits
- ``-ENODEV`` — BAR has no dma-buf exporter (BAR not present or not MMIO)
- Other negative errno from ``dma_buf_fd()``

``SLASH_CTLDEV_IOCTL_GET_DEVICE_INFO``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reads the PCI identity fields of the accessed card. Callers use this to correlate a control device
fd with a physical board and with the matching QDMA control device.

**Interface:**

.. code-block:: c

    #define SLASH_CTLDEV_IOCTL_GET_DEVICE_INFO _IOWR('v', 0x32, struct slash_ioctl_device_info)

    #define SLASH_PCI_BDF_LEN 32

    struct slash_ioctl_device_info {
        __u32 size;                   /* [in/out] ABI version */
        char  bdf[SLASH_PCI_BDF_LEN]; /* [out] PCI BDF string, NUL-terminated, e.g. "0000:61:00.2" */
        __u16 vendor_id;              /* [out] PCI vendor ID (0x10EE for AMD/Xilinx) */
        __u16 device_id;              /* [out] PCI device ID (0x50B6 for PF2) */
        __u16 subsystem_vendor_id;    /* [out] PCI subsystem vendor ID */
        __u16 subsystem_device_id;    /* [out] PCI subsystem device ID */
    };

**Direction:** ``_IOWR`` — userspace writes ``size``; the kernel writes back all output fields.

**Preconditions:** None.

**Postconditions:**

- All output fields are populated.
- ``bdf`` is a NUL-terminated string in ``DDDD:BB:SS.F`` format with full domain.

**Return values:**

- ``0`` — success
- ``-EFAULT`` — copy failure

Memory transfers via QDMA: ``/dev/slash_qdma_ctl<N>``
=====================================================

The QDMA device manages DMA queue pairs for bulk data movement between host memory and the card's
on-board memory (HBM or DDR). Each queue pair is allocated with a mode (currently only MM) and a
direction mask, then started before use. An anon-inode fd obtained from the queue pair serves as
the I/O channel: ``write()`` performs H2C transfers, ``read()`` performs C2H transfers, and the
file position encodes the device-side physical address.

- **Device file name:** ``/dev/slash_qdma_ctl<N>`` (e.g. ``/dev/slash_qdma_ctl0``)
- **Sysfs name:** ``slash_qdma_ctl_<PCI-BDF>`` (e.g. ``/sys/class/misc/slash_qdma_ctl_0000:61:00.1``)
- **Associated PCI function:** PF1, device ID ``10EE:50B5``
- **Permissions:** ``0600``
- **Creation:** one per card, created when PF1 is probed
- **File operations:** ``open``, ``release``, ``ioctl`` on the control fd. DMA I/O is done on
  per-qpair anon-inode fds returned by an ioctl.

Same stable-``N`` mapping scheme as the control device, using a separate BDF-to-number map.

Usage
-----

In order to transfer data via QDMA, a queue pair must be added, started, and an I/O fd needs
to be created. The I/O fd treats the file position as the device-side physical address:
``write()`` performs an H2C (host-to-card) transfer, and ``read()`` performs a C2H (card-to-host)
transfer. Full lifecycle:

.. code-block:: c

    /* Step 1: Add queue pair (MM mode, bidirectional) */
    struct slash_qdma_qpair_add add = {
        .size         = sizeof(add),
        .mode         = 0,    /* QDMA_Q_MODE_MM */
        .dir_mask     = 0x3,  /* H2C | C2H */
        .h2c_ring_sz  = 0,
        .c2h_ring_sz  = 0,
        .cmpt_ring_sz = 0,
    };
    ioctl(qdma_fd, SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_QPAIR_ADD, &add);
    uint32_t qid = add.qid;

    /* Step 2: Start the queue pair */
    struct slash_qdma_qpair_op op = { .size = sizeof(op), .qid = qid, .op = 0 };
    ioctl(qdma_fd, SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_Q_OP, &op);  /* START */

    /* Step 3: Obtain I/O fd */
    struct slash_qdma_qpair_fd_request fd_req = {
        .size = sizeof(fd_req), .qid = qid, .flags = O_CLOEXEC
    };
    int io_fd = ioctl(qdma_fd, SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_QPAIR_GET_FD, &fd_req);

    /* Step 4: H2C transfer to device address 0x4000000000 */
    pwrite(io_fd, host_buf, nbytes, 0x4000000000LL);

    /* Step 5: C2H transfer from device address 0x4000000000 */
    pread(io_fd, host_buf, nbytes, 0x4000000000LL);

    /* Step 6: Teardown */
    close(io_fd);
    op.op = 1;  ioctl(qdma_fd, SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_Q_OP, &op);  /* STOP */
    op.op = 2;  ioctl(qdma_fd, SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_Q_OP, &op);  /* DEL */

The file position can also be set explicitly with ``lseek`` before a plain ``read()``/``write()``:

.. code-block:: c

    lseek(io_fd, 0x1000, SEEK_SET);
    write(io_fd, src_buf, nbytes);

``lseek`` supports all flags ``SEEK_SET``, ``SEEK_CUR``, and ``SEEK_END``, and both ``pread`` and
``pwrite`` are supported. However, the fd does **not** support ``mmap``, ``poll``/``select``, or
``splice``.

All transfers are synchronous and block until the transfer completes or times out. The timeout is
**10 seconds**; after expiry the call returns ``-ETIME``. Partial transfers are possible; the
return value is the number of bytes transferred, and the file position is advanced accordingly.

Multiple fds can be obtained for the same qpair via multiple ``QPAIR_GET_FD`` calls, including
from different processes. Concurrent ``read()``/``write()`` calls on the same qpair (from any
fd or thread) are serialized by the kernel and execute one at a time; for parallel I/O, allocate
additional qpairs via ``QPAIR_ADD``. See the `Concurrency Model`_ section for the full safety
contract and its current testing caveat.

The following errno values can be returned by ``read()`` and ``write()`` on the I/O fd:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Return value
     - Condition
   * - ``>= 0``
     - Bytes transferred (success; partial transfer is possible)
   * - ``-ENODEV``
     - Device shutting down, or the required direction is not enabled for this qpair
   * - ``-EINVAL``
     - Zero-length transfer (``count`` results in 0 pages)
   * - ``-ENOMEM``
     - SGL allocation failure
   * - ``-EFAULT``
     - ``get_user_pages_fast`` returned fewer pages than needed (bad userspace buffer)
   * - ``-ETIME``
     - 10-second DMA timeout
   * - Other libqdma errors
     - Propagated from ``qdma_request_submit()``

Device Address Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The queue pair fd treats the file position as the device-side physical address in the
`16 TB NoC Interconnect Address Map`_. Within this address map, there are three particular
regions of interest:

.. _16 TB NoC Interconnect Address Map: https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/am011-versal-acap-trm/16-TB-NoC-Interconnect-Address-Map

     - ``0x0000000142100000``

FPGA Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FPGA programming (loading a new bitstream/PDI) is performed as a DMA write to the bitstream
programming region (``0x102100000``) over an H2C-only MM queue pair.

IOCTL Reference
---------------

All QDMA control device ioctls use magic byte ``'v'`` (``0x76``) and sequence numbers
``0x50``-``0x53``.

Every QDMA ioctl returns ``-ENODEV`` immediately if the hardware is shutting down (``hw_shutdown``
flag set) or the QDMA handle is not open.

``SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_INFO``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Queries QDMA device capabilities. All output fields are currently zero; this ioctl is a placeholder
for future capability reporting. Callers should issue it during initialization but make no decisions
based on the returned values in the current implementation.

**Interface:**

.. code-block:: c

    #define SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_INFO _IOWR('v', 0x50, struct slash_qdma_info)

    struct slash_qdma_info {
        __u32 size;        /* [in/out] ABI version */
        __u32 qsets_max;   /* [out] Max queue sets (currently always 0) */
        __u32 msix_qvecs;  /* [out] MSI-X vectors for queues (currently always 0) */
        __u32 vf_max;      /* [out] Max VFs (currently always 0) */
        __u32 caps;        /* [out] Capability bitmask (currently always 0) */
    };

**Direction:** ``_IOWR`` — userspace writes ``size``; the kernel writes back all output fields.

**Preconditions:** None beyond the standard size-field protocol.

**Postconditions:**

- All output fields are set to 0 in the current implementation.

**Return values:**

- ``0`` — success
- ``-EFAULT`` — copy failure
- ``-ENODEV`` — device shutting down or QDMA handle not open

``SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_QPAIR_ADD``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allocates a new queue pair on the device. On success, the kernel-assigned queue pair ID (``qid``)
is returned in the struct and is used for all subsequent operations on this queue pair.

**Interface:**

.. code-block:: c

    #define SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_QPAIR_ADD _IOWR('v', 0x51, struct slash_qdma_qpair_add)

    struct slash_qdma_qpair_add {
        __u32 size;          /* [in/out] ABI version */
        __u32 mode;          /* [in]  Queue mode: 0=MM (Memory Mapped), 1=ST (Streaming, not yet supported) */
        __u32 dir_mask;      /* [in]  Direction bitmask (see below) */
        __u32 h2c_ring_sz;   /* [in]  H2C descriptor ring CSR table index: 0–15 */
        __u32 c2h_ring_sz;   /* [in]  C2H descriptor ring CSR table index: 0–15 */
        __u32 cmpt_ring_sz;  /* [in]  Completion ring CSR table index: 0–15 */
        __u32 qid;           /* [out] Kernel-assigned queue pair ID */
    };

     - CMPT (completion queue; not yet supported)

Ring size fields are QDMA Control and Status Register (CSR) table indices (0–15), not raw
descriptor counts. Index 0 maps to approximately 2049 descriptors; index 15 to approximately
16385. The caller does not control the actual descriptor count directly.

**Direction:** ``_IOWR`` — userspace writes ``mode``, ``dir_mask``, and ring size indices; the
kernel writes back ``qid``.

**Preconditions:**

- ``dir_mask`` must be non-zero and contain only bits ``[0, 1]``; bit 2 (CMPT) is not yet
  supported
- ``mode`` must be 0 (MM); streaming mode (1) is not yet supported
- All ring size indices must be in ``[0, 15]``
- At most 256 concurrent queue pairs per device. The actual ceiling is lower in practice and
  depends on how many queues libqdma's resource manager makes available to the calling process
  (the 256-slot pool is shared across all PCI functions of the device).

**Postconditions:**

- ``qid`` is filled with the kernel-assigned ID (0–255), used for all subsequent operations on
  this queue pair.

**Return values:**

- ``0`` — success
- ``-EFAULT`` — copy failure
- ``-EINVAL`` — invalid ``dir_mask``, ``mode``, or ring size index
- ``-EOPNOTSUPP`` — streaming mode or completion queue requested (not yet supported)
- ``-ENOMEM`` — allocation failure
- ``-EBUSY`` — no qpair IDs available (the per-process queue ceiling has been reached)
- ``-ENODEV`` — device shutting down
- Other negative errno from libqdma's ``qdma_queue_add()``

``SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_Q_OP``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Performs a lifecycle operation (start, stop, or delete) on an existing queue pair. The expected
lifecycle is: ``ADD → START → [I/O via qpair fd] → STOP → DEL``.

**Interface:**

.. code-block:: c

    #define SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_Q_OP _IOWR('v', 0x52, struct slash_qdma_qpair_op)

    struct slash_qdma_qpair_op {
        __u32 size; /* [in/out] ABI version */
        __u32 qid;  /* [in]     Queue pair ID from QPAIR_ADD */
        __u32 op;   /* [in]     Operation: 0=START, 1=STOP, 2=DEL */
    };

Operations:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ``op``
     - Constant
     - Effect
   * - 0
     - ``SLASH_QDMA_QUEUE_OP_START``
     - Activates all HW queues in the pair. Must be called before any I/O.
   * - 1
     - ``SLASH_QDMA_QUEUE_OP_STOP``
     - Quiesces all HW queues. Required before DEL (but DEL implies STOP).
   * - 2
     - ``SLASH_QDMA_QUEUE_OP_DEL``
     - Removes all HW queues and releases the qpair entry from the xarray.

DEL is safe to call on a running queue (the kernel will stop it first), so an explicit STOP before
DEL is not strictly required but is the recommended sequence. After DEL, the qpair ID may be reused
by a subsequent ``QPAIR_ADD``. Any open anon-inode fds obtained via ``QPAIR_GET_FD`` still hold a
ref on the entry; they remain valid until closed, but the underlying hardware queues will have been
removed.

**Direction:** ``_IOWR`` — userspace writes ``qid`` and ``op``; no kernel-to-userspace data.

**Preconditions:**

- ``op`` must be in ``[0, 2]``
- ``qid`` must refer to an existing queue pair

**Postconditions:**

- On START: all HW queues in the pair are active; I/O on the qpair fd is possible.
- On STOP: all HW queues are quiesced.
- On DEL: the qpair entry is removed from the xarray; the ``qid`` may be reused.

**Return values:**

- ``0`` — success
- ``-EFAULT`` — copy failure
- ``-EINVAL`` — ``op`` value not in ``[0, 2]``
- ``-ENOENT`` — ``qid`` not found in the device's xarray
- ``-ENODEV`` — device shutting down
- Other negative errno from libqdma queue start, stop, or remove

``SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_QPAIR_GET_FD``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creates a new file descriptor for data transfer on an existing queue pair. The returned fd supports
``read``, ``write``, ``pread``, ``pwrite``, and ``lseek``; it does **not** support ``mmap``,
``poll``/``select``, or ``splice``. Multiple fds can be obtained for the same qpair via multiple
calls. The fd is returned as the ``ioctl()`` return value.

**Interface:**

.. code-block:: c

    #define SLASH_QDMA_IOCTL_QPAIR_GET_FD _IOWR('v', 0x53, struct slash_qdma_qpair_fd_request)

    struct slash_qdma_qpair_fd_request {
        __u32 size;   /* [in/out] ABI version */
        __u32 qid;    /* [in]     Queue pair ID (must exist and be non-empty) */
        __u32 flags;  /* [in]     fd flags: only O_CLOEXEC is honoured */
    };

**Direction:** ``_IOWR`` — userspace writes ``qid`` and ``flags``; the kernel returns the new fd
as the ``ioctl()`` return value (not as a struct field).

**Preconditions:**

- ``qid`` must refer to an existing, non-empty queue pair
- ``flags & ~O_CLOEXEC == 0`` (any other bits cause ``-EINVAL``)
- The queue pair should be in the started state for I/O to work

**Postconditions:**

- The return value is a non-negative fd number on success.
- The fd holds a reference on both the qpair entry and the device; neither can be freed while
  this fd is open.

**Return values:**

- ``>= 0`` — file descriptor (success)
- ``-EFAULT`` — copy failure
- ``-EINVAL`` — unsupported ``flags`` bits
- ``-ENOENT`` — ``qid`` not found or qpair is empty
- ``-ENODEV`` — device shutting down
- ``-ENOMEM`` — allocation failure
- Other negative errno from ``anon_inode_getfile()`` or ``get_unused_fd_flags()``

Device resets and hotplugging: ``/dev/slash_hotplug``
=====================================================

The hotplug device provides privileged control over the PCIe lifecycle of SLASH cards. It supports
removing a device from the PCI hierarchy, rescanning root buses to rediscover devices, issuing a
secondary bus reset (SBR) on the upstream bridge for a full hardware reset, and an atomic
remove-and-rescan operation. These operations are used after loading a new FPGA bitstream and when
performing a full board reset.

- **Device file name:** ``/dev/slash_hotplug``
- **Permissions:** ``0600``
- **Creation:** exactly one instance, created at module load, destroyed at module unload
- **File operations:** ``ioctl`` only (includes 32-bit compat path). No ``open``, ``release``,
  ``read``, ``write``, or ``mmap``.

Usage
-----

Full FPGA Reconfiguration (with secondary bus reset)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a complete reconfiguration where the FPGA is fully reset, remove both PFs, assert a secondary bus
reset, wait for FPGA re-initialization, then rescan:

.. code-block:: c

    struct slash_hotplug_device_request req = { .size = sizeof(req) };

    /* Remove both PFs */
    snprintf(req.bdf, sizeof(req.bdf), "0000:61:00.1");
    ioctl(hp_fd, SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_REMOVE, &req);
    snprintf(req.bdf, sizeof(req.bdf), "0000:61:00.2");
    ioctl(hp_fd, SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_REMOVE, &req);

    /* Assert SBR (blocks ~1 s internally for link retraining) */
    snprintf(req.bdf, sizeof(req.bdf), "0000:61:00.0");  /* bus matters, not function digit */
    ioctl(hp_fd, SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_TOGGLE_SBR, &req);

    /* Wait for FPGA re-initialization — caller responsibility */
    sleep(7);  /* 5–10 s recommended */

    /* Rescan all root buses */
    ioctl(hp_fd, SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_RESCAN, NULL);
    /* /dev/slash_ctl<N> and /dev/slash_qdma_ctl<N> reappear */

Hotplug Remove and Rescan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a simple teardown and re-add without reset, remove by BDF then rescan:

.. code-block:: c

    /* Remove by BDF */
    struct slash_hotplug_device_request req = { .size = sizeof(req) };
    snprintf(req.bdf, sizeof(req.bdf), "0000:61:00.2");
    ioctl(hp_fd, SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_REMOVE, &req);

    /* Rescan */
    ioctl(hp_fd, SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_RESCAN, NULL);

Or atomically via HOTPLUG (remove + rescan on the same bus):

.. code-block:: c

    snprintf(req.bdf, sizeof(req.bdf), "0000:61:00.2");
    ioctl(hp_fd, SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_HOTPLUG, &req);

IOCTL Reference
---------------

All hotplug ioctls use magic byte ``'w'`` (``0x77``) and sequence numbers ``0x30``–``0x33``.

Three of the four ioctls (``REMOVE``, ``TOGGLE_SBR``, ``HOTPLUG``) share the following request
struct:

.. code-block:: c

    #define SLASH_HOTPLUG_BDF_LEN 32

    struct slash_hotplug_device_request {
        __u32 size;                        /* ABI version; 0 is accepted (treated as sizeof) */
        char  bdf[SLASH_HOTPLUG_BDF_LEN]; /* NUL-terminated PCI BDF, e.g. "0000:03:00.0" */
    };

The BDF format is ``DDDD:BB:SS.F`` with full domain prefix. Leading and trailing whitespace are
trimmed before parsing.

``SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_RESCAN``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rescans all PCI root buses to discover new or reconfigured devices. Typically called after
``REMOVE`` or ``TOGGLE_SBR`` to rediscover a device.

**Interface:**

.. code-block:: c

    #define SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_RESCAN _IO('w', 0x30)

**Direction:** ``_IO`` — no argument. Pass ``NULL`` as the third argument to ``ioctl()``.

**Preconditions:** None.

**Postconditions:**

- All PCI root buses have been scanned under ``pci_lock_rescan_remove()``.
- Any new or reconfigured PCI devices are discovered and probed.

**Return values:**

- ``0`` — success (always succeeds if the kernel PCI lock can be acquired)

``SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_REMOVE``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removes a PCI device identified by BDF from the PCI hierarchy, triggering the driver's ``.remove``
callback. The corresponding ``/dev/slash_ctl<N>`` or ``/dev/slash_qdma_ctl<N>`` node disappears.

**Interface:**

.. code-block:: c

    #define SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_REMOVE _IOW('w', 0x31, struct slash_hotplug_device_request)

**Direction:** ``_IOW`` — userspace writes the BDF; no kernel-to-userspace data.

**Preconditions:**

- ``bdf`` must be a valid, parseable ``DDDD:BB:SS.F`` string (or empty for single-device shorthand)
- ``size`` must cover the ``bdf`` field (or be 0, treated as ``sizeof``)

**Postconditions:**

- Bus mastering is disabled on the device (``pci_clear_master()``).
- The device is removed from the PCI hierarchy (``pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device()``).
- The driver's ``.remove`` callback is invoked; associated device nodes disappear.

**Return values:**

- ``0`` — success
- ``-EFAULT`` — copy failure
- ``-EINVAL`` — malformed BDF or request ``size`` too small
- ``-ENODEV`` — device not found in PCI subsystem

``SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_TOGGLE_SBR``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Asserts a secondary bus reset (SBR) on the upstream PCIe bridge for the bus specified by BDF,
performing a full hardware reset of all endpoints on that bus. The ioctl blocks for approximately
1000 ms internally for PCIe link retraining; userspace should wait an **additional 5–10 seconds**
after the call returns before rescanning.

**Interface:**

.. code-block:: c

    #define SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_TOGGLE_SBR _IOW('w', 0x32, struct slash_hotplug_device_request)

**Direction:** ``_IOW`` — userspace writes the BDF; no kernel-to-userspace data.

**Preconditions:**

- ``bdf`` must be a valid ``DDDD:BB:SS.F`` string; only the domain and bus number are used to
  locate the upstream bridge
- The endpoint device may have been removed before calling; the kernel resolves the bridge via the
  bus number, which persists after endpoint removal

**Postconditions:**

- Bridge config space is saved, ``PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_BUS_RESET`` is asserted for at least 2 ms,
  deasserted, and config space is restored.
- The ioctl sleeps 1000 ms for PCIe link retraining before returning.
- The PCIe link is retrained; the FPGA may still be initializing after return.

**Return values:**

- ``0`` — success (after 1000 ms delay)
- ``-EFAULT`` — copy failure
- ``-EINVAL`` — malformed BDF
- ``-ENODEV`` — no upstream bridge found for the specified bus

``SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_HOTPLUG``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Atomically removes and rescans a single PCI device under the PCI lock. This is equivalent to
``REMOVE`` followed immediately by ``RESCAN`` on the same parent bus, without releasing the lock
between operations. Does **not** include an SBR; use ``TOGGLE_SBR`` separately if a hardware reset
is needed.

**Interface:**

.. code-block:: c

    #define SLASH_HOTPLUG_IOCTL_HOTPLUG _IOW('w', 0x33, struct slash_hotplug_device_request)

**Direction:** ``_IOW`` — userspace writes the BDF; no kernel-to-userspace data.

**Preconditions:**

- ``bdf`` must be a valid, parseable ``DDDD:BB:SS.F`` string
- The device and its parent bus must exist in the PCI subsystem

**Postconditions:**

- The device is removed (``pci_clear_master()`` + ``pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device()``).
- The parent bus is rescanned (``pci_rescan_bus()``); the device reappears if hardware is present.
- Both operations complete atomically under ``pci_lock_rescan_remove()``.

**Return values:**

- ``0`` — success
- ``-EFAULT`` — copy failure
- ``-EINVAL`` — malformed BDF
- ``-ENODEV`` — device or parent bus not found
